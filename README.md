how-to-mark-gmail-high-priority
 
Gmail did not provide options to prioritize email based on **low** , **normal** or **high**. Google learns which emails are important to you by evaluating: frequently and which open quickly.

But, you still make this email important, wit just put in the subject:
```
***Important - the real subject
***Urgent - ther real subject
! - the real subject
```
